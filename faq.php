                                <br/> Travellers get compensated for helping to buy back overseas products.

                                Our vision is to make the world a borderless place, for sharing of goods, for requesters to get their items at lower shipping cost and for travellers to maximise their under utilized luggage space. 
                                <br/> We believe that sharing is caring and we hope to build a community that help each other to make the world a better place.
